# Dotfiles

My configuration files for my development environment; a continual work in progress.

## Vim

Plug-in manager is currently [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug).
Key-mappings are influenced by Chris Toomey of Thougtbot/Upcase, following watching their Vim trails on Upcase.

## Zsh

Current uses the [zplug](https://github.com/zplug/zplug) plugin manager.
