# Dotfiles

My configuration files for my development environment; a continual work in progress.

## Vim

Plug-in manager is currently [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim).
Key-mappings are influenced by Chris Toomey of Thougtbot/Upcase, following watching their Vim trails on Upcase.

## Zsh

Current uses the [Oh-my-Zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) framework for managing configuration.
